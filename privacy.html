			<p><span class="style20">This Privacy Policy explains how Canary Falls Software LLC (&quot;Canary Falls&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) collects, uses, and may in some cases disclose information collected through your use of Canary Falls' Supervote website and application (&quot;Supervote&quot;, &quot;Services&quot;). This Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into our Terms of Service. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email us at &#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#111;&#116;&#101;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Privacy and Public Expression</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">Supervote contains features that allow you to control how you express yourself and to whom. Primarily, this means we help you express yourself to your friends. We may provide controls that allow you to control or reveal some information about yourself with others within the Service itself. We try to make this clear and easy for you to understand. Most importantly, you should understand that things that you do in public are public and you should act accordingly. We are not responsible for any such use, sharing, or disclosures.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>User Information Collection and Use by Supervote</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">Supervote collects user-submitted information such as ZIP code and voter endorsements.  ZIP code information allows us to provide relevant election information.  Voter endorsements are shared with your friends only if you explicitly share with them.  We may aggregate voter endorsements into reports and may make these reports publicly available or make available by subscription.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>IP Address and Technical Information</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">We log non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to our websites and applications. This data is used to manage our websites and applications, track usage, and improve the Services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third parties to provide more relevant services and opportunities for civic participation without identifying you individually in any way to such parties. User IP addresses may be recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Email Addresses and In-Service Communications</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">We may use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the Services. We do not make email address information available to others except in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Within the Services, via display or other messaging systems, you may receive messages that we or our subscribers believe may be of interest to you.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Additional Uses of Information</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">In addition to any other purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, we may process personal information collected through your use of the Services for the following purposes: to provide our products and services to users, including the display of customized Content and new services; to conduct audits, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve the Services; to ensure the technical functioning of the Services; and to develop new services.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Links</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">Supervote may contain links to other websites and applications not controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other websites and applications. When linking to another website or application, a user should read the privacy policy stated on that website or application. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Security</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">Supervote takes precautions to ensure that Member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect user information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to user information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel, service administrators, and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the website. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at privacy@supervote.org. Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your personally-identifiable information and communications will remain private and will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we maintain and make every effort to comply with evolving privacy standards, we do not promise, nor should you expect, that your personally-identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Sharing and Disclosure of Information We Collect</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">We will not disclose personally-identifiable information to any third party without the users permission in accordance with the Terms or this Privacy Policy unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) enforce the Terms or to protect our rights; or (3) protect the safety of members of the public and users of the Service. We reserve the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information because of the sale of Canary Falls or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">From time to time we may make changes to our Privacy Policy. Our most current Privacy Policy will always be posted on all of the Services. A user is bound by any minor changes to the Privacy Policy when she or he uses the website or applications after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users personally-identifiable information in a manner materially less restrictive from that stated at the time of collection, we will seek to obtain your consent through reasonable means which may include posting a notice on the Services for 30 days.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by &quot;opting in&quot; to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our services. Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal information held about themselves. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with applicable law. Please submit any requests for access to your personal data in writing to &#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#111;&#116;&#101;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style20"><strong>Contacting Us</strong></span></p>
			<p><span class="style20">If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy and/or practices, please send an e-mail to: &#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#111;&#116;&#101;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;.</span></p>
